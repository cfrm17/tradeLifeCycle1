# Trade Life Cycle Management Part 1

A trade, also called a deal, is an exchange of financial products from one entity to another. The life cycle of a trade is the fundamental activity of exchanges, investment banks, hedge funds, pension funds and many other financial companies.

 All the steps involved in a trade, from the point of order placed and trade execution through to settlement of the trade, are commonly referred to as the trade life cycle. Trade life cycle consists of a series of logical stages and steps.

1.	Pre-sale stage: Marketing persons from investment banks, brokers and dealers introduce various financial products and vehicles to clients. Investors or institutional fund managers survey the market and find the most suitable and competitive products.
2.	Trade execution: After trading negotiations between seller and buyer, an order is placed and the trade is executed. The completion of a buy or a sell order of a financial product is known as Trade Execution.
3.	Trade Capture: After trade execution, the trade is booked in the Front Office system, Middle Office Risk Management system and Back Office system.
4.	Trade Validation and Confirmation: Back office validates trade attributes and confirms trade settlement. Risk Management checks the valuation, risks and limits.
5.	Trade Settlement: Any fee or premium needs to be settled. For a periodic cash settlement trade, such as interest rate swaps or bonds, there is a process of simultaneous exchange of cash between parties at each payment date.
6.	Trade Termination: A trade may be expired at maturity or terminated early. The early termination  could be caused by a position sell or triggered by an early termination provision, such as auto call/cancel, knock-out, etc.

1.	Trade Capture
First of all, a user needs to download and install FinPricing application. After registering an account and logging in, the user should create a least one book to hold trades. You can find the instruction of managing books at http://www.finpricing.com/faq/manageBook.html. A book is a collection of financial assets. It could be a portfolio or trading strategy or desk. FinPricing portfolio management supports multi-level book(portfolio) hierarchies.
FinPricing provides two interfaces for users to capture trades:
•	Book a single trade
•	Book multiple batch trades

Trade life cycle has different stages, by which a trade flows through. These detail steps are from the point of order, receipt, execution and settlement of trades in a systematic manner. In other words, it is regarded as a series of logical steps which are represented in such a manner where the trade is allowed to go through keeping track of its related objective and importance.
